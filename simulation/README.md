General usage notes 
--------------------------------------------
- launch the base code for bar_simulation  gazebo.launch 
------------------------------------
install gazebo 
-----------------------------------
There was a custom world created in gazebo, the models where made in sketch up and fitted to spawn in gazebo. The bottles had special textures added to them so that the ar-tags are readable, there where also arranged carefully so there where in reach of the fetch robot. The fetch robot was also spawned in gazebo so that it was the correct distance away from bar so it could reach the bottles. There was also a bar tender added to give the world a realistic feel.
